**Features:**
- **Session Length Control:** Users can adjust the duration of both work sessions (session length) and break sessions (break length) using the provided controls.
- **Timer Display:** The application prominently displays the current session type (either "Session" or "Break") and the time remaining in the session.
- **Start/Stop Functionality:** Users can easily start or pause the timer by clicking the "Start/Stop" button.
- **Reset Functionality:** To reset the timer and return to the default settings of a 25-minute work session and a 5-minute break session, users can click the "Reset" button.
- **Audio Notification:** An audible alert (a beep sound) is played when the timer switches between work and break sessions or when the timer reaches zero.

**Technologies Used:**
- **React.js:** The application is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables the creation of interactive and responsive components.
- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets are utilized to style the user interface, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive design.
- **HTML:** HTML is used to structure the elements of the application and define their behavior.

**Usage:**
1. Adjust the session length and break length using the respective increment and decrement buttons.
2. Click the "Start/Stop" button to initiate or pause the timer.
3. During a work session, the timer will count down until reaching zero, signaling the end of the session with an audio notification.
4. The timer will automatically transition to a break session, allowing users to take a short break.
5. After the break session, the timer resets to the next work session, and the cycle repeats.
6. To reset the timer to its initial settings or make changes to the session lengths, simply click the "Reset" button.

**Note:** This Pomodoro timer is a basic implementation of the technique and can be customized or enhanced with additional features based on user preferences and requirements. Its simplicity and versatility make it a valuable tool for managing time effectively.
